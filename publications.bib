abstract = { Clock synchronization in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a critical aspect of ensuring reliable and energy-efficient communications among devices within a network. In this paper, we propose an entirely autonomous and lightweight Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to learn the periodicity of synchronized beacon transmissions between a transmitter and several receivers, while maximizing the sleep time between successive beacons to conserve energy. To do so, the proposed approach exploits a set of states, actions, and rewards so that each device adapts the radio-on time accordingly. The approach runs on each individual receiver without any prior knowledge of the network status. It is implemented and tested on off-the-shelf ESP32 IoT devices which are known to exhibit high clock drift rates. The testbed results demonstrate the ability of the approach to autonomously synchronize the receivers while achieving a similar performance in terms of packet (beacon) reception ratio but 45% better energy efficiency compared to a traditional approach followed in the literature for one-to-many type of synchronization. Apart from the improved energy consumption, the power characterization of the system shows that the RL approach requires negligible CPU resources. },

abstract = {In the last few years, a particular interest in using wireless technologies in the industrial domain in order to automate processes and increase the level of safety has been noticed. This paper introduces an affordable mobile system to notify railway workers in rural areas about the approach of trains, and thus, to enhance their safety allowing for the early evacuation of repair sites located near the rails. The system comprises three key elements: a train device, a portable station device, and wearable devices for the workers. The communication methods and the underlying protocols between these components are discussed in detail. The system has been developed for freight trains of the national railway company of Kazakhstan and has undergone extensive testing for each of its components before its final trial. The preliminary results demonstrate that the system meets the requirements in terms of evacuation time, range, and portability, while exhibiting a very low cost of manufacturing. More specifically, the system can achieve a reliable communication range of several kilometers and a maximum response time of 2.3 s. The cost does not exceed $500 for a set of train, station, and 5 worker devices.}
